## 📌 Project Description  
This project focuses on detecting **audio deepfakes** using machine learning techniques. 🎤 With the increasing prevalence of manipulated audio in digital media, detecting deepfakes is crucial for maintaining trust in communications. This system analyzes **audio features** to determine whether an audio clip is **real** ✅ or **fake** ❌ using advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms.  

### 🛠️ What does your application do?  
🔍 The application detects whether an audio sample is **real or fake** by analyzing its features and comparing it with a trained model. It uses signal processing and machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in speech patterns, tone, and other subtle cues that indicate **manipulation**.  

### 💡 Why did you use the technologies you did?  
- 🎵 **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**: Extracts important features from audio signals, highly representative of human speech.  
- 🎼 **Mel-Spectrogram**: Visualizes frequency content over time, aiding in distinguishing real and fake audio.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Algorithms**: **SVM, Random Forest** efficiently classify real vs. fake audio using extracted features.  

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- 📊 **Data Quality**: Ensuring a balanced dataset with an equal mix of real and fake audio.  
- 🔄 **Overfitting**: Ensuring the model generalizes well on unseen data.  
- 🎙️ **Feature Extraction**: Extracting useful features while minimizing noise.  

### 🚀 Features & Implementation  
✅ **Preprocessing**: Extracts **MFCC** and **Mel-spectrogram** from audio files.  
✅ **Model Training**: Uses **machine learning algorithms** to classify audio.  
✅ **Real-Time Detection**: Processes audio files to detect deepfakes.
