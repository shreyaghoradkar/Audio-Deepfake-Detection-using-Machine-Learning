Overview
This project focuses on detecting audio deepfakes using machine learning techniques. It employs various models to analyze audio files and determine whether the audio has been manipulated or is genuine. Audio deepfakes pose a significant threat to security and media integrity, and this system aims to offer an automated approach for detecting them.

The project uses advanced algorithms to identify discrepancies in speech patterns, tone, and unnatural speech sequences, which are typical characteristics of deepfake audio.

Setup Information
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Audio-Deepfake-Detection-using-Machine-Learning.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Audio-Deepfake-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Install Required Libraries Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Download the audio dataset you plan to use for training and testing. Ensure that the dataset is structured correctly and placed in the appropriate folder in the project directory.

How to Use
Run the Main Script To start the deepfake detection, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_deepfake_audio.py
Provide the Audio File The script will prompt you to input the path of the audio file you want to test. You can provide either a real or a fake audio file, and the model will analyze it.

View the Results After processing, the system will output the likelihood of the audio being a deepfake or real based on the trained model.

Project Information
This project is built with machine learning techniques to distinguish real and fake audio. It utilizes a dataset of both real and deepfake audio samples for training. The model is evaluated on accuracy, and the system is designed to be extendable for further improvements and integration with other systems.

The project is highly focused on improving model accuracy, so more datasets will be added regularly to enhance detection capabilities.
